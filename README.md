# d.velop cloud SDK for .NET core

This is the official SDK to build Apps for [d.velop cloud](https://www.d-velop.de/cloud/) using 
the C# programming language.

The project has alpha status. **So for now expect things to change.** 

## Usage

Include the the d.velop cloud sdk as dependencies in your .NET Core 2.1 project file (`myproject.csproj`) and restore them with `dotnet restore` via commandline or from within your IDE.

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Dvelop.Sdk." Version="0.0.1.28-prerelease" />
</ItemGroup>
```

or the all-in-one dependency:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Dvelop.Sdk" Version="0.0.1.28-prerelease" />
</ItemGroup>
```

More info on usage of sdk classes and the sources itself will come soon.
